                    <p class="body-copy">For nearly 3 decades I have grown my company by creating lifesaving
                        innovations for medical device manufactures. During this time, I have developed patented
                        technologies to thwart surgery site infection. My machinery is used worldwide by the nation’s
                        largest medical device makers.</p>

                    <p class="body-copy">As a member of a scientific review board I co-developed micro-surgical devices
                        that broke away from the conservative product development models. 25 years ago with zero
                        funding I founded my medical device packaging company that has grown to be an industry leader.
                        I continue to innovate with new patent pending devices with an aim to save thousands of lives
                        each year.</p>

                    <p class="body-copy">I have a passion for industrial design and new device development and I
                        believe it shows in the products and the company I have created.</p>

                        marketing street smarts and market knowledge guide you to a successful new product development

                        but also requires and records the process. As the medical device packaging industry demands
                        tighter controls, smarter packaging machines like ours may soon be a mandate. This again is an

                        The packaging problem represents a huge loss to the maker and also creates a risk to the
                        sanitation and safety of the packages content. With the patent pending “grow carton” the
                        container can expand when shipped to higher elevations without compromising the content. The
                        accordion style pleats that at first are canceled under the deep lid cuff, can deploy to
                        accommodate the expanding Frozen content.</p>
